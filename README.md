# Mathematical-Morphology
Mathematical morphology is a term for several methods and techniques in the field of image processing which are used to alter, extract and transform the geometric shapes of images and objects. The main idea in all morphological operators is to use simple binary shapes (usually much smaller than the image) called “structuring elements” of size m x n and compare them with all m x n sub-matrices of the image. The way in which these “structuring elements” interact with the sub-matrices of the image allows us to draw conclusions and perform several operations such as removing small objects, filling holes, completing lines and so on.
